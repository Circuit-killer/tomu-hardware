A tiny ARM microprocessor which fits in your USB port.

Has two buttons and two LEDs.

Built out of a 3d printed part + a "flex PCB".

Uses a Silicon Labs EFM32HG309

The important features are;
 * QFN24 - 5mm x 5mm package
 * Inbuilt 5V to 3V3 regulator.
 * Crystal-less USB

These make something which is almost hand solder-able fit into the tiny size.
